Example42 Puppet Modules

A collection of modules for Puppet with the following targets:
- Multi OS support and easy integration of new OS
- Sysadmin oriented approach (for easier integration and customization)
- Support for a growing number of applications
- Adherence to Puppet modules standards
- No enforcing of a specific logic for files management.

Some research and sperimentation is done on:
- Definition and use of enhanced abstraction classes such as backup, monitor, firewall
- Definition of a standard and pluggable define for inline modifications
- Setup of Puppet toasters and baselines

NOTE: The whole project is a work in progress.
