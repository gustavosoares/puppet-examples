DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages postfix.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configation files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include postfix              # Install and run postfix with standard configurations.
include postfix::disable     # Disable postfix service.
include postfix::disableboot # Disable postfix service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include postfix::absent      # Remove postfix package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include postfix::monitor     # Monitor postfix  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include postfix::backup      # Backup postfix data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include postfix::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for postfix service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
postfix::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
postfix::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
